# aca-latex format

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template acastroaraujo/aca-latex
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

_Note: This template requires the "[Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code)" font for code blocks. You may have to tinker with the `extrafont` package. Good luck!_
